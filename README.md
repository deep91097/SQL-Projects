# SQL-Projects
I have created this repository for my SQL Projects. Thank you for looking in to my Projects 
I took super store data in the form of 5 tables (Orders, Customers, Products, Locations, FT) from single CSV file and wrote the queries for the following questions:
1)	Are my top 5 customers profitable?
2)	Find out the customer retention rate. The formula for the same is no. of repeat customers/number of total customers.
3)	Which are the Top 10 cities with maximum number of Customers?
4)	Find out the Top 3 sub-categories of each category
5)	Who are the customers who have not placed any orders in the last 2 months?
6)  Performed Some Random Analysis to support my Data Science Findings
